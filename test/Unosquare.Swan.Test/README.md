# Unosquare Swan Unit Tests

## Notes

If you want to run all the test you need to bring up the SMTP Dev server ([MailDev](https://www.npmjs.com/package/maildev)). You need Node.js (probably you already have it) and install maildev to run the mail.js script.

```
# npm install maildev
# node ./mail.js
```
